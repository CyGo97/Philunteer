# Philunteer

This is an app that was made for Femmehacks 2017, an all-women hackathon. 

Inspiration: 
We are students at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and we feel passionate about giving back to the community. What better way to do this if not through combining it with our other passion for computer science?

What it does: 
There are two different ways one can use this Android app: as a volunteer or as an organization. As a volunteer, one has the option to find an event in Philadelphia by looking through a calendar of events that organizations post their events on. As an organization, one can post an event specifying the details of the organization and the event.

How we built it: 
We used Android Studio and our knowledge of Java.

Challenges we ran into: 
This was our first time using Android Studio and making an app, thus we had to teach ourselves along the way. Without prior knowledge, finding the proper classes and methods we wanted to use was the most difficult aspect.

What's next for Philunteer: 
We would like to perfect it and make it public so that it can be used by the residents of Philadelphia.
